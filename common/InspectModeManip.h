/*! camera manipulator with the following traits

    - there is a "point of interest" (POI) that the camera rotates
    around.  (we track this via poiDistance, the point is then
    thta distance along the fame's z axis)

    - we can restrict the minimum and maximum distance camera can be
    away from this point

    - we can specify a max bounding box that this poi can never
    exceed (validPoiBounds).

    - we can restrict whether that point can be moved (by using a
    single-point valid poi bounds box

    - left drag rotates around the object

    - right drag moved forward, backward (within min/max distance
    bounds)

    - middle drag strafes left/right/up/down (within valid poi
    bounds)
